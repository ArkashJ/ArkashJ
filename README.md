## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated with a combined BA [Mathematics and Computer Science] and MS [Computer Science] from Boston University bringing with me experience from a Venture Capital Firm [Battery Ventures 2x sourcing intern, diligence intern - https://www.battery.com], BCH (through BU Spark] and a tech startup [Zerosync - https://www.zerosync.co]. 

My master's theses focused on Streaming & Event driven systems [more specifically, adaptive checkpointing in Flink] and Numerically Stable Momentum Based SGD Algorithms. 

With a keep passion for System Design, I write a monthly blog, [https://medium.com/@arkjain] highlighting various online algorithms for Stream Processing Engines, Sorting Algorithms, KV and Columnar Stores, Adaptive Techniques for Task Placement on the Cloud, ML etc.

At the Kirchhausen Lab, I've worked on the Incasem [https://github.com/kirchhausenlab/incasem] and CryoSamba [https://x.com/KirchhausenLab/status/1813651584427184490] projects so far, automating the entire workflows, introducing vanilla architectural decisions such as local config and runtime managers, custom loggers, end to end tests, benchmarks, scripts and lightweight APIs for ease-to-use GUIs.

*Currently I'm building a UNet architecture for Image Segmentation and a Self-Supervised Vision Transformer for Object Detection.*
